# TreePPL Documentation

Our documentation follows the [diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach to technical document writing and therefore it is structured in :

 - [tutorials](docs/Tutorials) is a practical activity, in which the user learns by doing something meaningful, towards some achievable goal.
 - [how-to guides](docs/Howtos) helps the user get something done, correctly and safely; it guides the user’s action.
 - [explanation](docs/Explanation) deepens and broadens the reader’s understanding of a subject. It brings clarity, light and context.
 - [reference](docs/Reference) material contains theoretical knowledge that a user looks to in their work.

If you are new to TreePPL, we recommend beginning at the [Getting Started Tutorial](docs/Tutorials/getting-started).
