    <h1>TreePPL â€“ A Probabilistic Programming Language for Statistical Phylogenetics</h1>


<p>
Probabilistic programming techniques have developed rapidly in recent
years. The ultimate vision is to provide expressive, Turing-complete
model description languages, while at the same time supporting the
automated generation of efficient inference algorithms from these
model descriptions. This would allow empiricists to easily and
succinctly describe any model they might be interested in, relying on
the automated machinery to provide efficient inference algorithms for
that model.
</p>

<p>
Current probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are often difficult
to use for empiricists. Furthermore, even though there is now swift
progress in PPL inference strategies, there is still a substantial gap
in many domains before PPL systems can compete successfully with
dedicated software, or even provide computationally feasible
solutions.
</p>

<p>
  The aim of the TreePPL project is to develop a domain-specific PPL
  for statistical phylogenetics. There are three specific design
  goals:
<ol>

  <li>TreePPL should be easy to use for empiricist. A source of
  inspiration in this context is <a href="http://webppl.org/">WebPPL</a>,
  which we think is one of the most accessible PPLs in terms of
  syntax. Beyond an intuitive syntax, TreePPL also needs to have
  extensive support for model components that are commonly used in
  phylogenetics.

  <li>TreePPL should provide state-of-the-art efficiency in the
  inference algorithms it generates from phylogenetic model
  descriptions.

  <li>TreePPL should support advanced users that want to experiment
  with inference algorithms or develop entirely new inference
  strategies for phylogenetic models.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In
a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154443v1">recent
paper</a>, we introduce probabilistic programming and develop
efficient PPL approaches to advanced models of biological
diversification, such as the BAMM model and the ClaDS models,
using <a href="http://webppl.org/">WebPPL</a> and another recent
PPL, <a href="https://birch-lang.org">Birch</a>.  The paper
demonstrates some of the potential power of probabilistic programming
in statistical phylogenetics, and discusses the main hurdles that
remain to be tackled before these techniques can be applied to the
entire range of phylogenetic models.
</p>

<p>
TreePPL will be built on top
of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3357766.3359531">Miking</a>, a
language framework for constructing efficient compilers for
domain-specific languages.
</p>

<p>
This web site will be continuously updated, with the ultimate aim of
developing it into the primary online resource for the TreePPL
community.
